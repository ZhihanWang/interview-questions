### Getting started

If you're not too familiar with `git`, then follow the steps below to get started!

1. Click `Fork` at the top-right of this repository and create a fork under your GitHub account.
2. Open your terminal and navigate to a folder of your choice
3. Run `git clone https://github.com/<YOUR_USERNAME_HERE>/interview-questions.git` to clone the repository
4. Go into that folder (`cd interview-questions`) and start working!
    - If you have `Node.js` installed, you can run `node questions.js` from your terminal to check your answers are working
    - If you don't have `Node.js` installed, you can try copying your code into an online editor such as `http://repl.it` to test your answers
5. When you're done add, commit and submit your work by creating a pull request! **Note: You can commit as often as you like!**
    - `git add .`
    - `git commit -m "<MY NAME HERE> answers"`
    - `git push origin master`
    - Go to your forked repository and click `New pull request`. The **base** should be `altitudelabs/interview-questions` and the **compare** should be `<YOUR_USERNAME_HERE>/interview-questions`
    - Submit! ðŸŽ‰
